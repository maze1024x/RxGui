The RxGui Project
=================

**RxGui** is a high-level GUI framework based on Qt Widgets.
It enables developers to create classic widget apps
with a modern paradigm featuring the power of `ReactiveX <https://reactivex.io/>`_.

The framework is basically an interpeter of
its purpose-designed programming language called **RxScript**,
which is a static-typed interpreted language
shipping with language-level support for ReactiveX.

The paradigm is similar to modern Web frameworks (React, Vue, Angular)
but refined to leverage the full power of ReactiveX.
It will be easy to learn for Web developers who are familiar to RxJS.

This documentation assumes prior knowledge about ReactiveX
and basic functional programming practices.
