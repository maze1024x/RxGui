# RxGui

RxGui is a high-level GUI framework based on Qt Widgets.
It enables developers to create classic widget apps
with a modern paradigm featuring the power of ReactiveX.

## Development

The main objective of this project (implementing a new paradigm)
has been accomplished.
Thus, its development is paused until users appear.
If someone is going to acutally use this project,
I will come back on demand.

You can contact me using the email address shown on my GitHub profile,

## Project History

This project started as a programming language project.
However, A standalone programming language does not do much,
therefore I make it a UI framework at the same time.

This repo only contains commits that are created
after I decided to release a beta.
Old commits can be found before a tag in an experimental repo:
